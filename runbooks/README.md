# Runbooks

Operational checklists and incident workflows intended to support routine maintenance, reliability hygiene, and incident response across platform and infrastructure services.

These runbooks are written as lightweight, practical references rather than exhaustive documentation.

## Maintenance

- **vmware-host-upgrade-checklist.md**

## Conventions

- Runbooks are written as checklists to reduce cognitive load during operational events.
- Each runbook emphasizes validation, rollback considerations, and post-change documentation.
- Content is intentionally scoped to support repeatable operational workflows rather than platform-specific how-to guides.
